# File Box

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jhoneagle/FIleBox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jhoneagle/FIleBox)

Web application for sharing and/or externally storing files that don't cross 60MB. Project is done using spring boot and thymeleaf and yes interface is not the most elegant one but still. Goal was anyway to (learn how to) create Dropbox/Google Drive like application. 

Implementation contains for example custom permission evalution and custom validators.
